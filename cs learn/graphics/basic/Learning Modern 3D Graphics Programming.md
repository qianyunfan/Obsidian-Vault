This is a book from [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming (nicolbolas.github.io)](https://nicolbolas.github.io/oldtut/index.html), which consolidates the foundation of computer graphics. I am a noob and i read two chapter of it, it is very clear for me.

# Basic
- Image is made up of 2D pixels(picture element).
- 3D world into a 2D image of that world is called _rendering_.
- There are several methods for rendering a 3D world. The process used by real-time graphics hardware, such as that found in your computer, involves a very great deal of fakery. This process is called _rasterization,_ and a rendering system that uses rasterization is called a _rasterizer._
